    <h2>Hello, I'm Benen</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm an always-learning builder and creator</p>
    <br>
    <p>In a past life, I was extremely interested in finance and investing. I wrote a series of articles on a popular investment website and regularly achieved over 10,000 readers. I even worked for a "tiger cub" hedge fund in an investment role. I've examined funeral homes in Canada, furniture makers in Australia, steel makers in India and everything in between.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Then I realized it was all meaningless</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Since then, I've been exploring the startup world. I'm heavily involved in the entrepreneurship scene on campus and am currently working on a product that's beginning the go-to-market process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Independence is the most important thing in my life. That why even though I'll be working as a Product Manager for a healthcare data startup this summer, I hope I'll be doing well enough that I'll quit my job and never have to have one ever again. </p>
